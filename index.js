// Write your code here
// 1. Create a variable called `multiply` set to an equation that will multiply the variables 
//`num1` and `num2`; the result of the multiplication should be `62`.
//2. Create a variable called `random` that will generate a random integer greater than 0.
//3. Create a variable called `mod` set to an equation that will calculate the remainder 
//of dividing variable `num3` by `num4`; the remainder should be `4`.
//4. Create a variable called `max` that finds the highest number in a set; the
  // value returned should be `20`.

  let num1 = 4;
  let num2 = 15.5;
  const multiply = num1 * num2;
  
  let random = Math.floor(Math.random()*10);

  let num3 = 20;
  let num4 = 5;
  let mod = num3 & num4;
  
  let max = Math.max(4,8,12,16,20);
